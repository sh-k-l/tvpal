# TV Pal

A full stack MERN application to track TV shows and organise them into a ranking list, which you can then share.

API and Front end hosted on Heroku: https://tv-pal-2020.herokuapp.com/app
DB hosted on MongoDB Atlas

Some things I learned while making this:
- How Redux and React-Redux works
- Deploying a full stack application (this was my first time, figuring out how to serve a react-router app via express took some time)
- Cancelling Promises if components are unmounted in React
